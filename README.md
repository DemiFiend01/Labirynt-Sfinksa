Labirynt Sfinksa is a Python-based maze game project focused on procedural maze generation and AI-driven entity behavior by using Gemini API.

The project implements core gameplay mechanics such as player movement, map management, object interaction, and rendering.

The codebase is organized in a modular way, with separate components responsible for game logic, game flow management, maze generation, object rendering, and supporting utilities. 

This structure emphasizes clean code organization, readability, and ease of extension.

The project serves as a practical exercise in Python programming, game loop control, basic AI logic, and algorithmic problem-solving related to maze generation and navigation.

Important!

The ray-casting technique and player movement were based on this very helpful tutorial:
